WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 00.00.0235
--------------------------------

React Native Fixes:
 - Usage view should display time in local time
 - When no drive data, format better the Usage view.
 - App displays instructions to reset sensor if connection fails
 - Usage view displays date and time and mileage of last trip
 - Modals are not translated and not in the correct units - esp. changing the mileage.
 - Add back the "AskMiles" button at the top right, and point it to carfit's zendesk account under all conditions (Auth0 and Norauto) using the right language code.
 - CARFIT usage is showing in Miles for FR (should be in KM for all regions except the US and UK).
 - REMOVE FROM UI: Be able to take a picture of the user car.
 - App fails to pair the sensor and gets stuck with no "Continue" button.
 - My Account shows "Mes vehicules" as the title.
