# About this Repository #

This repository contains the build infrastructure for the iOS and Android REACT Native CARFIT applications.

## Setting-up your REACT Native Project ##

In the scaffolding branch, there is a "docs" directory.  This directory is where you will find the information needed to setup your REACT Native project.

Start by following the instructions here:
* ReactNative_CARFIT / docs / SETUP.md 

Pay special attention to include:
* Android SDK Build-tools (**Important: Rev. 23.0.1**)

You may need to load the Android version of the project into Android Studio in order to resolve dependencies if at first the project won't build.

You can find more information here:
